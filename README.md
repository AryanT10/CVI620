## Introduction

This Repository covers simple computer vision concepts, such as capturing digital images and video, applying simple and arithmetic changes to images (e.g. crop, rotate, enhance color), and extracting information from images (e.g. finding or counting objects). Also, concepts such as tracking objects in a video sequence are introduced. I have worked on project targeting a computer vision application such as face recognition, security systems, medical imaging, robotics, and others.
